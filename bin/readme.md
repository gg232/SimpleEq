VST3 for Windows 64-bit only. (There's nothing special stopping one from compiling the plugin for a 32-bit and/or non-Windows platform or different plugin format, but just for lack of time, this will have to suffice.)

Also, its built in debug mode, so maybe don't use this version. That beig said, no problems in REAPER so far...
